Test/Tryout WinHTTP


Windows 32/64 warning!

Windows 64 bit (i.e. Windows 7/2008) has independent registry settings
for 32 bit and 64 programs. 

Hence to change the registry settings for the proxy settings 
(ex. to use Fiddler with WinHTTP) call netsh from corresponding cmd prompt:

C:\Windows\SysWOW64\cmd.exe (for Win32 apps)
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe (for Win64 apps, counter intuitive but true)

To import settings from Internet Explorer (IE) call:
[CMD from above] netsh winhttp import proxy ie
